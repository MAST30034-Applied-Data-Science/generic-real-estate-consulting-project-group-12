We not only focus on the current transaction, but look after our clients over the years with all of their property needs. Your immediate requirement may be to sell a family home. Later there may be a need to buy an investment property to lease out either personally or through a super fund, change business premises or be the executor of an estate. We can help with any of these objectives.</p><p>Our confidential advice takes into account all of your property needs and personal concerns. It is important to thoroughly make sure that your property decisions are based on sound principals before you act.</p><p>We can assist and advise on investment properties, matrimonial disputes and partnership dissolutions, deceased estates and mortgagee's sales, commercial, industrial and business transactions.</p><p>Our service extends throughout the northern and eastern suburbs of Melbourne. With modern communications, mobile phones and the internet the 'local agent' syndrome went out years ago, so we are able to assist with your needs in any north-eastern, northern or eastern suburb. However, only qualified, experienced and competent estate agents can successfully achieve results consistently. We offer far more than just being a local agent.</p><p>Between 80-90% of our work is by way of either recommendation or referral. We always welcome new customers, so please give us a call if you are looking for a reliable service. Remember there is no substitute for quality service.</p><p>Independence</p><p>We are proudly an Australian owned independent office.</p><p>Most multi office groups rely on massive marketing (at your cost) and the 'glossy tag' of a network or franchise brand name.

62,5,60 Hoddle Street,,"Killen Thomas (Aust) Pty Ltd is an established Real Estate Practice whose history dates back to 1911 when it was established in New South Wales. 
Over time the company has developed a strong reputation and reliable practice in both Sydney and in Melbourne where the office was opened in 1983 covering all real estate disciplines. 

In 1992 a management buyout of Killen Thomas was effected by the current principals and directors to take the firm into todays highly competitive business environment thus creating a powerful and proactive real estate agency force.

With an enviable reputation as a full house agency, Killen Thomas have positioned themselves as an alternative to the larger and more inflexible agencies, and have achieved a pre-eminent and trustworthy respect within todays property and business community. 

At Killen Thomas, we aim to be different and establish policies which maintain the highest standards of real estate expertise and professionalism.

The original office of Love Real Estate was established in the newly created Melbourne suburb of Reservoir, and with the rapid growth since then of Melbourne City to the North, Love Real Estate now has an additional 6 offices located in Thornbury, Preston, Thomastown, Mill Park and Epping.

With the further construction of Melbourne’s Western Ring Road and CityLink, and the resulting development of extensive commercial and industrial facilities to maximise predominantly transport and logistical benefits to business, John Love identified an opportunity to capitalise on the increase in demand for the sale and management of commercial and industrial properties in the region.

Based upon this business opportunity, Love Commercial was established in 1997 and now offers a specialist service in Commercial and Industrial Real Estate from Footscray in Melbourne’s west, around the city’s northern fringe, to the Dandenong ranges in Melbourne’s east. A second office in Bayswater supports Love Commercial’s Headquarters in Reservoir. 

Love Commercial provides specialist services and professional advice regarding complex Commercial and Industrial Real Estate issues such as:


• The Goods and Services Tax (GST)
• Retail Tenancies Legislation
• Depreciation along with more complex building information and management systems
• Sales/Auctions/Leasing
• Property Management
• Certified Valuations etc

The team at Love Commercial prides itself on delivering specialist service and advice that is not only reliable, accurate and cost efficient, but most importantly, reflects an extensive knowledge of local market conditions.

We can help with any of these objectives.</p><p>Our confidential advice takes into account all of your property needs and personal concerns. It is important to thoroughly make sure that your property decisions are based on sound principals before you act.</p><p>We can assist and advise on investment properties, matrimonial disputes and partnership dissolutions, deceased estates and mortgagee's sales, commercial, industrial and business transactions.</p><p>Our service extends throughout the northern and eastern suburbs of Melbourne. With modern communications, mobile phones and the internet the 'local agent' syndrome went out years ago, so we are able to assist with your needs in any north-eastern, northern or eastern suburb.

244,4,"Level 1, 2 Ralph St",,"Love Commercial represents the natural expansion of the family run Love Real Estate residential network founded in 1945 by Mr E J Love.

The original office of Love Real Estate was established in the newly created Melbourne suburb of Reservoir, and with the rapid growth since then of Melbourne City to the North, Love Real Estate now has an additional 6 offices located in Thornbury, Preston, Thomastown, Mill Park and Epping.

With the further construction of Melbourne’s Western Ring Road and CityLink, and the resulting development of extensive commercial and industrial facilities to maximise predominantly transport and logistical benefits to business, John Love identified an opportunity to capitalise on the increase in demand for the sale and management of commercial and industrial properties in the region.

Based upon this business opportunity, Love Commercial was established in 1997 and now offers a specialist service in Commercial and Industrial Real Estate from Footscray in Melbourne’s west, around the city’s northern fringe, to the Dandenong ranges in Melbourne’s east. A second office in Bayswater supports Love Commercial’s Headquarters in Reservoir. 

Love Commercial provides specialist services and professional advice regarding complex Commercial and Industrial Real Estate issues such as:


• The Goods and Services Tax (GST)
• Retail Tenancies Legislation
• Depreciation along with more complex building information and management systems
• Sales/Auctions/Leasing
• Property Management
• Certified Valuations etc

The team at Love Commercial prides itself on delivering specialist service and advice that is not only reliable, accurate and cost efficient, but most importantly, reflects an extensive knowledge of local market conditions.

Over time the company has developed a strong reputation and reliable practice in both Sydney and in Melbourne where the office was opened in 1983 covering all real estate disciplines. 

In 1992 a management buyout of Killen Thomas was effected by the current principals and directors to take the firm into todays highly competitive business environment thus creating a powerful and proactive real estate agency force.

With an enviable reputation as a full house agency, Killen Thomas have positioned themselves as an alternative to the larger and more inflexible agencies, and have achieved a pre-eminent and trustworthy respect within todays property and business community. 

At Killen Thomas, we aim to be different and establish policies which maintain the highest standards of real estate expertise and professionalism.

314,4,"Level 1, 2 Ralph St",,"Love Commercial represents the natural expansion of the family run Love Real Estate residential network founded in 1945 by Mr E J Love.

The original office of Love Real Estate was established in the newly created Melbourne suburb of Reservoir, and with the rapid growth since then of Melbourne City to the North, Love Real Estate now has an additional 6 offices located in Thornbury, Preston, Thomastown, Mill Park and Epping.

With the further construction of Melbourne’s Western Ring Road and CityLink, and the resulting development of extensive commercial and industrial facilities to maximise predominantly transport and logistical benefits to business, John Love identified an opportunity to capitalise on the increase in demand for the sale and management of commercial and industrial properties in the region.

Based upon this business opportunity, Love Commercial was established in 1997 and now offers a specialist service in Commercial and Industrial Real Estate from Footscray in Melbourne’s west, around the city’s northern fringe, to the Dandenong ranges in Melbourne’s east. A second office in Bayswater supports Love Commercial’s Headquarters in Reservoir. 

Love Commercial provides specialist services and professional advice regarding complex Commercial and Industrial Real Estate issues such as:


• The Goods and Services Tax (GST)
• Retail Tenancies Legislation
• Depreciation along with more complex building information and management systems
• Sales/Auctions/Leasing
• Property Management
• Certified Valuations etc

The team at Love Commercial prides itself on delivering specialist service and advice that is not only reliable, accurate and cost efficient, but most importantly, reflects an extensive knowledge of local market conditions.

</b></p><p>We believe the industry must accept a change in the way salespeople operate being an industry leader, Changing Places have introduced a “Fixed Fee” commission structure based on the general demographic of the buyer, and the level of effort and resources required to achieve the best possible outcome for our clients, not the dollar value of your property. Our unique business model allows us to reduce running costs without sacrificing our world-class service, therefore we choose to pass this saving onto our clients saving you up to 65% on typical agent’s fees.
</p><p><b>2. Our Centralised Database
</b></p><p>We are in constant communication with a vast number of qualified buyers each week. These buyers are entered into our centralized data management system can opt in to automatically advised of any new property listings that match their buying criteria. Unlike traditional agency networks, all of our Area Specialists have access to this national network of buyers, effectively allowing our salespeople to market your property on a national scale putting your property in front of more buyers each week.
</p><p><i>More Buyers + Emotionally Connected + In Competition = Premium Price
</i></p><p><b>3. Our National Network of Salespeople
</b></p><p>We employ, train and support a National network of salespeople who are experts in their field and well networked within their territory. Our training is intense so we ensure each and every Area Specialist is fully equipped and capable to effectively manage the sale of your property.
</p><p><b>4. Our Website
</b></p><p>In today’s world over 85% of real estate business happens online. We provide a modern platform for buyers and sellers alike to obtain up-to-date information about the property market, industry trends and tips on buying and selling residential real estate. We are continually striving to push the limits of technology.
</p><p><b>5. A Tailored Approach
</b></p><p>We do not favour one sale method over another. The most effective method of sale can vary from suburb to suburb, state to state. It is our approach to act in the best interest of our clients and in too many cases a property is auctioned only to leave an owner ultimately disappointed. Our Experienced Area Specialists have an intimate knowledge of their marketplace and will submit their recommendations based on factual evidence and the individual needs of the property.
Fact: Out of area and passive buyers are more likely to pay a premium price for a property!
</p><p><b>6. Personal Service
</b></p><p>In most real estate agencies, you start out with the Principal of the firm or a Senior Salesperson, however, you ultimately find the person who ends up handing your sale is far less experienced. With Changing Places, the Area Specialist is dedicated to your property from day one and stays with you right throughout the sale process.
</p><p><b>7. Administration Support
</b></p><p>By providing exceptional administration support to all of our Area Specialists we eliminate a large percentage of downtime allowing our salespeople to focus the majority of their energy on achieving the best result for our clients, spending more time working with potential buyers for your property.
</p><p><b>8. Training & Development
</b></p><p>We believe training is key to success – all our salespeople go through an initial induction program into our brand were we teach demonstrate how our unique philosophy and commission structure can help everyday sellers who are looking for a great real estate experience.
In addition to this we provide access to ongoing training events and seminars to ensure our team are fully equipped with state-of-the-art tools, knowledge, and industry best practices ensuring the very best possible outcome can be achieved for our clients.

</b></p><p>We believe the industry must accept a change in the way salespeople operate being an industry leader, Changing Places have introduced a “Fixed Fee” commission structure based on the general demographic of the buyer, and the level of effort and resources required to achieve the best possible outcome for our clients, not the dollar value of your property. Our unique business model allows us to reduce running costs without sacrificing our world-class service, therefore we choose to pass this saving onto our clients saving you up to 65% on typical agent’s fees.
</p><p><b>2. Our Centralised Database
</b></p><p>We are in constant communication with a vast number of qualified buyers each week. These buyers are entered into our centralized data management system can opt in to automatically advised of any new property listings that match their buying criteria. Unlike traditional agency networks, all of our Area Specialists have access to this national network of buyers, effectively allowing our salespeople to market your property on a national scale putting your property in front of more buyers each week.
</p><p><i>More Buyers + Emotionally Connected + In Competition = Premium Price
</i></p><p><b>3. Our National Network of Salespeople
</b></p><p>We employ, train and support a National network of salespeople who are experts in their field and well networked within their territory. Our training is intense so we ensure each and every Area Specialist is fully equipped and capable to effectively manage the sale of your property.
</p><p><b>4. Our Website
</b></p><p>In today’s world over 85% of real estate business happens online. We provide a modern platform for buyers and sellers alike to obtain up-to-date information about the property market, industry trends and tips on buying and selling residential real estate. We are continually striving to push the limits of technology.
</p><p><b>5. A Tailored Approach
</b></p><p>We do not favour one sale method over another. The most effective method of sale can vary from suburb to suburb, state to state. It is our approach to act in the best interest of our clients and in too many cases a property is auctioned only to leave an owner ultimately disappointed. Our Experienced Area Specialists have an intimate knowledge of their marketplace and will submit their recommendations based on factual evidence and the individual needs of the property.
Fact: Out of area and passive buyers are more likely to pay a premium price for a property!
</p><p><b>6. Personal Service
</b></p><p>In most real estate agencies, you start out with the Principal of the firm or a Senior Salesperson, however, you ultimately find the person who ends up handing your sale is far less experienced. With Changing Places, the Area Specialist is dedicated to your property from day one and stays with you right throughout the sale process.
</p><p><b>7. Administration Support
</b></p><p>By providing exceptional administration support to all of our Area Specialists we eliminate a large percentage of downtime allowing our salespeople to focus the majority of their energy on achieving the best result for our clients, spending more time working with potential buyers for your property.
</p><p><b>8. Training & Development
</b></p><p>We believe training is key to success – all our salespeople go through an initial induction program into our brand were we teach demonstrate how our unique philosophy and commission structure can help everyday sellers who are looking for a great real estate experience.
In addition to this we provide access to ongoing training events and seminars to ensure our team are fully equipped with state-of-the-art tools, knowledge, and industry best practices ensuring the very best possible outcome can be achieved for our clients.

536,5,PO Box 1017,,"<p>What’s in a name? Elite is the word that guides the culture at Elite Women Real Estate (EWRE). The essential capabilities required to become a good real estate agent are strong active network connections, professional competency, firm negotiation services and familiarity with the economic variables that affect suburbs. The name EWRE means superior skills and culture.</p><p> 
EWRE embraces the superior values of equity and fairness and those tenets are reflected in every transaction. Nurturing skills requires a work culture that is safe to drive efficiency and effectiveness. When people are free to focus on work and are not distracted with negativity, productivity increases.  Extensively reported toxic workplaces illustrates clearly the cost to business and as we celebrate International Women’s Day, EWRE reflects that safe work culture. As ‘necessity is the mother of invention’ the need for change is here.</p><p> 
Real estate was originally male dominated and practitioners did not fully address the needs of women other than the stereotypical functional aspects of the property. Today, women are independent decision makers and investors with interests that far exceed traditional roles. As women entered the profession the fundamentals were retained however women added diversity and representation.</p><p> 
EWRE agents are the property relationship builders because women champion relationships. The resources within a location, the growth of the area, the development potential, migratory behaviours and the myriad of other associations are what EWRE capitalises on for buyers and sellers. Utilising local knowledge, macro fundamentals and an e-commerce platform makes EWRE a cost-effective disrupter.
</p><p>  
The distinctive skill set that EWRE agents offer, is derived from the inherent understanding of 52% of the population -women - clearly a point of difference. EWRE aims to service all real estate consumers and recognises the property relationship building elements that are needed. From home ownership to income supplementation and retirement planning the future of the real estate industry requires outstanding service and knowledge and that is what is in the name EWRE.</p>",ewreservicingvictoriaandqueenslandaustralia-30998,elizabeth@ewre.net.au,,True,30998,False,0411240333,"EWRE, Servicing Victoria and Queensland Australia",0,2,,elizabeth@ewre.net.au,03 88024418,True,VIC,Templestowe,03 88024418,

557,5,PO Box 1017,,"<p>What’s in a name? Elite is the word that guides the culture at Elite Women Real Estate (EWRE). The essential capabilities required to become a good real estate agent are strong active network connections, professional competency, firm negotiation services and familiarity with the economic variables that affect suburbs. The name EWRE means superior skills and culture.</p><p> 
EWRE embraces the superior values of equity and fairness and those tenets are reflected in every transaction. Nurturing skills requires a work culture that is safe to drive efficiency and effectiveness. When people are free to focus on work and are not distracted with negativity, productivity increases.  Extensively reported toxic workplaces illustrates clearly the cost to business and as we celebrate International Women’s Day, EWRE reflects that safe work culture. As ‘necessity is the mother of invention’ the need for change is here.</p><p> 
Real estate was originally male dominated and practitioners did not fully address the needs of women other than the stereotypical functional aspects of the property. Today, women are independent decision makers and investors with interests that far exceed traditional roles. As women entered the profession the fundamentals were retained however women added diversity and representation.</p><p> 
EWRE agents are the property relationship builders because women champion relationships. The resources within a location, the growth of the area, the development potential, migratory behaviours and the myriad of other associations are what EWRE capitalises on for buyers and sellers. Utilising local knowledge, macro fundamentals and an e-commerce platform makes EWRE a cost-effective disrupter.
</p><p>  
The distinctive skill set that EWRE agents offer, is derived from the inherent understanding of 52% of the population -women - clearly a point of difference. EWRE aims to service all real estate consumers and recognises the property relationship building elements that are needed. From home ownership to income supplementation and retirement planning the future of the real estate industry requires outstanding service and knowledge and that is what is in the name EWRE.</p>",ewreservicingvictoriaandqueenslandaustralia-30998,elizabeth@ewre.net.au,,True,30998,False,0411240333,"EWRE, Servicing Victoria and Queensland Australia",0,2,,elizabeth@ewre.net.au,03 88024418,True,VIC,Templestowe,03 88024418,

Little did they expect their enthusiasm and commitment to service would create a company that set the standard for the industry to follow. Hocking Stuart is a dynamic multi-office team with a hard-earned reputation for achieving the highest price in the marketplace. But we've never rested on our laurels and continue to introduce new ideas and innovative practices. Innovations such as Red, a high quality, colour property magazine produced weekly and Sunday open for inspections and auctions have been adopted by many others in an endeavour to emulate Hocking Stuart's success. Our clean, uncluttered website was designed by specialists to meet the consumer's every need so it's no coincidence it has the highest number of visits of any real estate agent's website in Victoria. All properties Hocking Stuart has for sale and lease are also featured on the three other leading real estate websites - realestateview.com.au, domain.com.au and realestate.com.au. Hocking Stuart's member only, personalised property matching system, Red First, is the first of its kind in Australia. Red First harnesses the power of the internet and the unmatched expertise of Hocking Stuart to assist buyers and tenants in finding their perfect property.

 relevant buyers for your property is one of our core strengths. We have
 one of the largest databases in South Eastern suburbs of Melbourne; our

to identify buyers whose criteria match your property. This approach is 
further complemented by our ability to locate buyers through our local 
community referral network.</p>

professionals in a range of fields... from sales, to marketing, 
auctioneering, property management and administration both Residential 
and Commercial. This gives us the ability to provide enhanced cultural 
understanding to our clients. The result is less ambiguity in the sales 
and leasing process and more satisfied clients who feel more informed 
and in control.</p>
<p><b>LOCAL EXPERTISE </b>Our intimate knowledge of the local 
property market is unsurpassed, enabling us to provide the highest 
quality advise and insight, our strong focus and customised approach to 
client service that sets us apart. Our team is well informed, 
professional and dedicated.  We are passionate about Real Estate and 
whole-heartedly love what we do!</p>

 clarity. We share information and develop business relationships built 
on trust.  Our ethical approach and our professional standards has been 
the foundation of Leyton's business growth. It has allowed us to be 
recognised as one of the most reputable and trusted agencies in the 
local community. We are confident that we can meet your property needs 
and we welcome the opportunity to work with you in the future.</p>

The original office of Love Real Estate was established in the newly created Melbourne suburb of Reservoir, and with the rapid growth since then of Melbourne City to the North, Love Real Estate now has an additional 6 offices located in Thornbury, Preston, Thomastown, Mill Park and Epping.

With the further construction of Melbourne’s Western Ring Road and CityLink, and the resulting development of extensive commercial and industrial facilities to maximise predominantly transport and logistical benefits to business, John Love identified an opportunity to capitalise on the increase in demand for the sale and management of commercial and industrial properties in the region.

Based upon this business opportunity, Love Commercial was established in 1997 and now offers a specialist service in Commercial and Industrial Real Estate from Footscray in Melbourne’s west, around the city’s northern fringe, to the Dandenong ranges in Melbourne’s east. A second office in Bayswater supports Love Commercial’s Headquarters in Reservoir. 

Love Commercial provides specialist services and professional advice regarding complex Commercial and Industrial Real Estate issues such as:


• The Goods and Services Tax (GST)
• Retail Tenancies Legislation
• Depreciation along with more complex building information and management systems
• Sales/Auctions/Leasing
• Property Management
• Certified Valuations etc

Our unique business model allows us to reduce running costs without sacrificing our world-class service, therefore we choose to pass this saving onto our clients saving you up to 65% on typical agent’s fees.

These buyers are entered into our centralized data management system can opt in to automatically advised of any new property listings that match their buying criteria. Unlike traditional agency networks, all of our Area Specialists have access to this national network of buyers, effectively allowing our salespeople to market your property on a national scale putting your property in front of more buyers each week.
</p><p><i>More Buyers + Emotionally Connected + In Competition = Premium Price
</i></p><p><b>3. Our National Network of Salespeople
</b></p><p>We employ, train and support a National network of salespeople who are experts in their field and well networked within their territory. Our training is intense so we ensure each and every Area Specialist is fully equipped and capable to effectively manage the sale of your property.
</p><p><b>4. Our Website
</b></p><p>In today’s world over 85% of real estate business happens online. We provide a modern platform for buyers and sellers alike to obtain up-to-date information about the property market, industry trends and tips on buying and selling residential real estate. We are continually striving to push the limits of technology.
</p><p><b>5. A Tailored Approach
</b></p><p>We do not favour one sale method over another. The most effective method of sale can vary from suburb to suburb, state to state. It is our approach to act in the best interest of our clients and in too many cases a property is auctioned only to leave an owner ultimately disappointed. Our Experienced Area Specialists have an intimate knowledge of their marketplace and will submit their recommendations based on factual evidence and the individual needs of the property.
Fact: Out of area and passive buyers are more likely to pay a premium price for a property!
</p><p><b>6. Personal Service
</b></p><p>In most real estate agencies, you start out with the Principal of the firm or a Senior Salesperson, however, you ultimately find the person who ends up handing your sale is far less experienced. With Changing Places, the Area Specialist is dedicated to your property from day one and stays with you right throughout the sale process.
</p><p><b>7. Administration Support
</b></p><p>By providing exceptional administration support to all of our Area Specialists we eliminate a large percentage of downtime allowing our salespeople to focus the majority of their energy on achieving the best result for our clients, spending more time working with potential buyers for your property.
</p><p><b>8. Training & Development
</b></p><p>We believe training is key to success – all our salespeople go through an initial induction program into our brand were we teach demonstrate how our unique philosophy and commission structure can help everyday sellers who are looking for a great real estate experience.
In addition to this we provide access to ongoing training events and seminars to ensure our team are fully equipped with state-of-the-art tools, knowledge, and industry best practices ensuring the very best possible outcome can be achieved for our clients.

798,5,PO Box 1017,,"<p>What’s in a name? Elite is the word that guides the culture at Elite Women Real Estate (EWRE). The essential capabilities required to become a good real estate agent are strong active network connections, professional competency, firm negotiation services and familiarity with the economic variables that affect suburbs. The name EWRE means superior skills and culture.</p><p> 
EWRE embraces the superior values of equity and fairness and those tenets are reflected in every transaction. Nurturing skills requires a work culture that is safe to drive efficiency and effectiveness. When people are free to focus on work and are not distracted with negativity, productivity increases.  Extensively reported toxic workplaces illustrates clearly the cost to business and as we celebrate International Women’s Day, EWRE reflects that safe work culture. As ‘necessity is the mother of invention’ the need for change is here.</p><p> 
Real estate was originally male dominated and practitioners did not fully address the needs of women other than the stereotypical functional aspects of the property. Today, women are independent decision makers and investors with interests that far exceed traditional roles. As women entered the profession the fundamentals were retained however women added diversity and representation.</p><p> 
EWRE agents are the property relationship builders because women champion relationships. The resources within a location, the growth of the area, the development potential, migratory behaviours and the myriad of other associations are what EWRE capitalises on for buyers and sellers. Utilising local knowledge, macro fundamentals and an e-commerce platform makes EWRE a cost-effective disrupter.
</p><p>  
The distinctive skill set that EWRE agents offer, is derived from the inherent understanding of 52% of the population -women - clearly a point of difference. EWRE aims to service all real estate consumers and recognises the property relationship building elements that are needed. From home ownership to income supplementation and retirement planning the future of the real estate industry requires outstanding service and knowledge and that is what is in the name EWRE.</p>",ewreservicingvictoriaandqueenslandaustralia-30998,elizabeth@ewre.net.au,,True,30998,False,0411240333,"EWRE, Servicing Victoria and Queensland Australia",0,2,,elizabeth@ewre.net.au,03 88024418,True,VIC,Templestowe,03 88024418,

Nicholls Gledhill is the longest operating agency in Endeavour Hills. It is not part of another franchise chain but an independent owner-operated family business managed by Harry Nicholls who started the company himself 40 years ago.

Harry is also a Certified Practising Valuer (AAPI), the only one in Endeavour Hills, an associate of the Real estate Institute of Victoria (AREI) and a past president of the REIV (Waverley Branch).

Other staff includes Harry’s son Matthew Nicholls (Office Manager) Laurel Heath (Rental Property Manager) who has had years of experience in this specialised field of real estate plus our dedicated team of sales, reception and clerical staff.

The fact that we operate from our own premises within the Terrace Shopping Centre means that we do not have the substantial overheads experienced by our competitors, expenses such as franchise fees, high shopping centre rentals, group advertising levies etc. Consequently we can offer a more experienced and professional service at more competitive rates.

In order to further improve our service to clients we have just taken over the adjacent premises and have totally refurbished our newly enlarged office complex.

As a result we can now boast the most impressive modern real estate office in the district as well as the biggest and best window display which is kept right up to date with all the best and latest listings. This display works day and night, week-in, week-out attracting potential buyers seeking home in the area. Undoubtedly the best possible place to present your home to the market.

Nicholls Gledhill is the longest operating agency in Endeavour Hills. It is not part of another franchise chain but an independent owner-operated family business managed by Harry Nicholls who started the company himself 40 years ago.

Harry is also a Certified Practising Valuer (AAPI), the only one in Endeavour Hills, an associate of the Real estate Institute of Victoria (AREI) and a past president of the REIV (Waverley Branch).

Other staff includes Harry’s son Matthew Nicholls (Office Manager) Laurel Heath (Rental Property Manager) who has had years of experience in this specialised field of real estate plus our dedicated team of sales, reception and clerical staff.

The fact that we operate from our own premises within the Terrace Shopping Centre means that we do not have the substantial overheads experienced by our competitors, expenses such as franchise fees, high shopping centre rentals, group advertising levies etc. Consequently we can offer a more experienced and professional service at more competitive rates.

In order to further improve our service to clients we have just taken over the adjacent premises and have totally refurbished our newly enlarged office complex.

As a result we can now boast the most impressive modern real estate office in the district as well as the biggest and best window display which is kept right up to date with all the best and latest listings. This display works day and night, week-in, week-out attracting potential buyers seeking home in the area. Undoubtedly the best possible place to present your home to the market.

Nicholls Gledhill is the longest operating agency in Endeavour Hills. It is not part of another franchise chain but an independent owner-operated family business managed by Harry Nicholls who started the company himself 40 years ago.

Harry is also a Certified Practising Valuer (AAPI), the only one in Endeavour Hills, an associate of the Real estate Institute of Victoria (AREI) and a past president of the REIV (Waverley Branch).

Other staff includes Harry’s son Matthew Nicholls (Office Manager) Laurel Heath (Rental Property Manager) who has had years of experience in this specialised field of real estate plus our dedicated team of sales, reception and clerical staff.

The fact that we operate from our own premises within the Terrace Shopping Centre means that we do not have the substantial overheads experienced by our competitors, expenses such as franchise fees, high shopping centre rentals, group advertising levies etc. Consequently we can offer a more experienced and professional service at more competitive rates.

In order to further improve our service to clients we have just taken over the adjacent premises and have totally refurbished our newly enlarged office complex.

As a result we can now boast the most impressive modern real estate office in the district as well as the biggest and best window display which is kept right up to date with all the best and latest listings. This display works day and night, week-in, week-out attracting potential buyers seeking home in the area. Undoubtedly the best possible place to present your home to the market.

Nicholls Gledhill is the longest operating agency in Endeavour Hills. It is not part of another franchise chain but an independent owner-operated family business managed by Harry Nicholls who started the company himself 40 years ago.

Harry is also a Certified Practising Valuer (AAPI), the only one in Endeavour Hills, an associate of the Real estate Institute of Victoria (AREI) and a past president of the REIV (Waverley Branch).

Other staff includes Harry’s son Matthew Nicholls (Office Manager) Laurel Heath (Rental Property Manager) who has had years of experience in this specialised field of real estate plus our dedicated team of sales, reception and clerical staff.

The fact that we operate from our own premises within the Terrace Shopping Centre means that we do not have the substantial overheads experienced by our competitors, expenses such as franchise fees, high shopping centre rentals, group advertising levies etc. Consequently we can offer a more experienced and professional service at more competitive rates.

In order to further improve our service to clients we have just taken over the adjacent premises and have totally refurbished our newly enlarged office complex.

As a result we can now boast the most impressive modern real estate office in the district as well as the biggest and best window display which is kept right up to date with all the best and latest listings. This display works day and night, week-in, week-out attracting potential buyers seeking home in the area. Undoubtedly the best possible place to present your home to the market.

</b></p><p>We believe the industry must accept a change in the way salespeople operate being an industry leader, Changing Places have introduced a “Fixed Fee” commission structure based on the general demographic of the buyer, and the level of effort and resources required to achieve the best possible outcome for our clients, not the dollar value of your property.

</b></p><p>We do not favour one sale method over another. The most effective method of sale can vary from suburb to suburb, state to state. It is our approach to act in the best interest of our clients and in too many cases a property is auctioned only to leave an owner ultimately disappointed. Our Experienced Area Specialists have an intimate knowledge of their marketplace and will submit their recommendations based on factual evidence and the individual needs of the property.

</p><p><b>7. Administration Support
</b></p><p>By providing exceptional administration support to all of our Area Specialists we eliminate a large percentage of downtime allowing our salespeople to focus the majority of their energy on achieving the best result for our clients, spending more time working with potential buyers for your property.

Tallon Estate Agents, not far from the original hardware store and milk bar. Whilst other businesses came and went, it stood firmly. Today, Tallon Estate Agents remain headed by the Tallon family, now with the Eview Group standing steadily in the wings.</p><p style=""box-sizing: border-box; vertical-align: baseline; font-family: CenturyGothic; font-size: 16px; outline: 0px; padding: 0px 0px 27px; margin: 0px; border: 0px; -webkit-font-smoothing: subpixel-antialiased; text-align: center; background-color: rgb(242, 245, 247);"">It was just over three decades ago that Alfred Tallon and his wife created this family estate agency, one you could rest weary arms on, and let them do the hard work.

After all, Dom's lived and breathed real estate ever since he can remember, with deals being discussed by his parents over the vegies and roast at the kitchen table. Absorbing information like a sponge from his toddler times, it was natural that he take the reins one day.</p><p style=""box-sizing: border-box; vertical-align: baseline; font-family: CenturyGothic; font-size: 16px; outline: 0px; padding: 0px 0px 27px; margin: 0px; border: 0px; -webkit-font-smoothing: subpixel-antialiased; text-align: center; background-color: rgb(242, 245, 247);"">Dom's reliable, dedicated and warm team specialise in residential sales, whilst Dom's work is cut out with large acquisition sales in the mix. With a background in residential sales, and a business degree with a major in accounting & management, it stands to reason that this successful Company Director handles large overseas and major Australian property deals with ease.</p><p style=""box-sizing: border-box; vertical-align: baseline; font-family: CenturyGothic; font-size: 16px; outline: 0px; padding: 0px 0px 27px; margin: 0px; border: 0px; -webkit-font-smoothing: subpixel-antialiased; text-align: center; background-color: rgb(242, 245, 247);"">But what makes Dom different is what comes with heart and soul. As Director of Eview Group Tallon Estate Agents, Dom's eye watches with care each and every property that moves in and out of his office. After all, he has his father's name to uphold.</p><p style=""box-sizing: border-box; vertical-align: baseline; font-family: CenturyGothic; font-size: 16px; outline: 0px; padding: 0px 0px 27px; margin: 0px; border: 0px; -webkit-font-smoothing: subpixel-antialiased; text-align: center; background-color: rgb(242, 245, 247);"">In the 1840's this village was simply a small fishing town named after its counterpart in the UK.

 respond to a more discerning clientele who value a level of service

enjoys the quiet con?dence of industry leadership. You will notice that 
we do not emblaze these claims on everything we do. As we see it, the 
strength of our process and our exceptional results naturally speak for 
themselves.</p>
<p>Oslo is an agency which elevates. At our very core is the 
understanding that positivity renders results and encouragement leads to
 attainment. When we form a relationship with a purchaser or a vendor, 
we become part of their story and they ours. Our process brings their 
property into centre focus and we embark on a collaborative journey with
 a shared vision of success.</p>

delivering what we set out to achieve, building relationships and 
elevating our anticipation. Ours is not an ethos of big claims and over 
the top movements. Ours is an ethos of nurturing, sustaining and 
responding to achieve success with consideration and efficiency. </p>
<p>Created by a collective of real estate professionals, Oslo emerged to
 respond to a more discerning clientele who value a level of service 
which is savvy, engaged and entrepreneurial.</p>
<p>By harnessing an intimate understanding of property within the 
region, we have designed an agency which develops relationships and 
enjoys the quiet con?dence of industry leadership. You will notice that 
we do not emblaze these claims on everything we do. As we see it, the 
strength of our process and our exceptional results naturally speak for 
themselves.</p>
<p>Oslo is an agency which elevates. At our very core is the 
understanding that positivity renders results and encouragement leads to
 attainment. When we form a relationship with a purchaser or a vendor, 
we become part of their story and they ours. Our process brings their 
property into centre focus and we embark on a collaborative journey with
 a shared vision of success.</p>
<p>We welcome you to experience what it means to work with an agency of 
calibre and creativity. An agency where we are not shiny, just natural. 
Sophisticated, not sleek. An agency which does not meet the market 
loudly, but moulds it quietly.</p>

<p class=""MsoNormal""><b>Delighted clients:</b></p>

<p class=""MsoNormal"">We aim to provide our clients a rewarding experience with
our real estate agency.</p>

<p class=""MsoNormal""><b>Proven results:</b></p>

<p class=""MsoNormal"">As real estate agents, we have achieved excellent sales and
benchmark results right across all price ranges. From $250,000 - $12,750,000.
We regularly sell properties that other real estate agents have failed to sell.</p>

<p class=""MsoNormal""><b>Client Care:</b></p>

<p class=""MsoNormal"">We ensure that everything we do is in the best interests of
our clients. This includes constantly honing our negotiation skills as a real
estate agent, not disclosing offers to ensure we get the highest price
possible, and not underselling the property just to make the sale.</p>

<p class=""MsoNormal""><b>Fair fees and charges:</b></p>

<p class=""MsoNormal"">We offer a fair commission rate and the advertising costs
are significantly lower than nearly all of our real estate competitors. We
believe that most real estate agents charge too much and deliver too little.</p>

<p class=""MsoNormal""><b>We genuinely do have buyers:</b></p>

<p class=""MsoNormal"">Our real estate agency has detailed records of all buyers
that contact us regarding properties for sale. </p>

<p class=""MsoNormal""><b>Accurate market assessments:</b></p>

<p class=""MsoNormal"">If you want to know the true value of your property, ask us.
You will receive an honest and accurate assessment of properties for sale based
on recent sales and comparable properties completely free of charge and
obligation.</p>

<p class=""MsoNormal""><b>Expertise:</b></p>

<p class=""MsoNormal"">We have been selling properties for more than 15 years, so
we know the business of real estate, the current market and more than likely,
the buyer for your home or property for sale.</p>

<p class=""MsoNormal""><b>Available 7 days:</b></p>

<p class=""MsoNormal"">Your property is always for sale when your real estate agent
is easy to contact. We work in the evenings and on Sundays, and regularly
receive great feedback from buyers that find other real estate agents hard to
catch.</p>



<p class=""MsoNormal"">If you are thinking of buying and/or selling real estate,
you should call us on: 03 9296 2044 or Scott McCormick 0409 216 465 anytime.</p>

At Choice Group Real Estate, we don’t just look at your property as bricks and mortar we look at it as a home filled with memories, another chapter in your story. We see potential for another story to come and we want to help you get the most out of your property so you can live with no regrets.
We know selling a home can be a daunting task, but we want to take the fear out of selling by putting your mind at ease by knowing that we’re always doing what’s best for you. We also make it a simple process and will involve you every step of the way.
The last thing we want you to feel is left out of the process, that’s why communication is key here at Choice Group Real Estate we’ll give you regular updates of interest we’ve had in the property and we’ll communicate any updates. In saying that, it doesn’t mean you’ll be bombarded with texts or calls, if you only want to hear from us once a week then that’s what we’ll do (unless we’ve received an offer of course!)
We have many platforms where we can advertise your property, whether it’s a ‘Coming Soon’ or ‘For Sale’ sign out the front, or an eye catching advert on domain , we also advertise on social media so people can tag friends or family who might be interested in the property.
We’re selling your property because it’s what we LOVE to do! Our favourite part of the process is seeing the smile on your face when the SOLD sticker goes on. Whether it’s vacant land, a local unit, a family home or a property with plenty of land we’re here to help you all the way and we want you to close this chapter with no regrets. ",choicerealestateshepparton-28921,pm@choicegroup.com.au,03 58317333,True,28921,False,,Choice Real Estate Shepparton,1,5,,pm@choicegroup.com.au,03 58215667,True,VIC,Shepparton,03 58215667,

</b></p><p>We believe the industry must accept a change in the way salespeople operate being an industry leader, Changing Places have introduced a “Fixed Fee” commission structure based on the general demographic of the buyer, and the level of effort and resources required to achieve the best possible outcome for our clients, not the dollar value of your property. Our unique business model allows us to reduce running costs without sacrificing our world-class service, therefore we choose to pass this saving onto our clients saving you up to 65% on typical agent’s fees.
</p><p><b>2. Our Centralised Database
</b></p><p>We are in constant communication with a vast number of qualified buyers each week. These buyers are entered into our centralized data management system can opt in to automatically advised of any new property listings that match their buying criteria. Unlike traditional agency networks, all of our Area Specialists have access to this national network of buyers, effectively allowing our salespeople to market your property on a national scale putting your property in front of more buyers each week.
</p><p><i>More Buyers + Emotionally Connected + In Competition = Premium Price
</i></p><p><b>3. Our National Network of Salespeople
</b></p><p>We employ, train and support a National network of salespeople who are experts in their field and well networked within their territory. Our training is intense so we ensure each and every Area Specialist is fully equipped and capable to effectively manage the sale of your property.
</p><p><b>4. Our Website
</b></p><p>In today’s world over 85% of real estate business happens online. We provide a modern platform for buyers and sellers alike to obtain up-to-date information about the property market, industry trends and tips on buying and selling residential real estate. We are continually striving to push the limits of technology.
</p><p><b>5. A Tailored Approach
</b></p><p>We do not favour one sale method over another. The most effective method of sale can vary from suburb to suburb, state to state. It is our approach to act in the best interest of our clients and in too many cases a property is auctioned only to leave an owner ultimately disappointed. Our Experienced Area Specialists have an intimate knowledge of their marketplace and will submit their recommendations based on factual evidence and the individual needs of the property.
Fact: Out of area and passive buyers are more likely to pay a premium price for a property!
</p><p><b>6. Personal Service
</b></p><p>In most real estate agencies, you start out with the Principal of the firm or a Senior Salesperson, however, you ultimately find the person who ends up handing your sale is far less experienced. With Changing Places, the Area Specialist is dedicated to your property from day one and stays with you right throughout the sale process.
</p><p><b>7. Administration Support
</b></p><p>By providing exceptional administration support to all of our Area Specialists we eliminate a large percentage of downtime allowing our salespeople to focus the majority of their energy on achieving the best result for our clients, spending more time working with potential buyers for your property.
</p><p><b>8. Training & Development
</b></p><p>We believe training is key to success – all our salespeople go through an initial induction program into our brand were we teach demonstrate how our unique philosophy and commission structure can help everyday sellers who are looking for a great real estate experience.
In addition to this we provide access to ongoing training events and seminars to ensure our team are fully equipped with state-of-the-art tools, knowledge, and industry best practices ensuring the very best possible outcome can be achieved for our clients.

At Choice Group Real Estate, we don’t just look at your property as bricks and mortar we look at it as a home filled with memories, another chapter in your story. We see potential for another story to come and we want to help you get the most out of your property so you can live with no regrets.
We know selling a home can be a daunting task, but we want to take the fear out of selling by putting your mind at ease by knowing that we’re always doing what’s best for you. We also make it a simple process and will involve you every step of the way.
The last thing we want you to feel is left out of the process, that’s why communication is key here at Choice Group Real Estate we’ll give you regular updates of interest we’ve had in the property and we’ll communicate any updates. In saying that, it doesn’t mean you’ll be bombarded with texts or calls, if you only want to hear from us once a week then that’s what we’ll do (unless we’ve received an offer of course!)
We have many platforms where we can advertise your property, whether it’s a ‘Coming Soon’ or ‘For Sale’ sign out the front, or an eye catching advert on domain , we also advertise on social media so people can tag friends or family who might be interested in the property.
We’re selling your property because it’s what we LOVE to do! Our favourite part of the process is seeing the smile on your face when the SOLD sticker goes on. Whether it’s vacant land, a local unit, a family home or a property with plenty of land we’re here to help you all the way and we want you to close this chapter with no regrets. ",choicerealestateshepparton-28921,pm@choicegroup.com.au,03 58317333,True,28921,True,,Choice Real Estate Shepparton,1,5,Shepparton,pm@choicegroup.com.au,03 58215667,True,VIC,Shepparton,03 58215667,

<p>Created by a collective of real estate professionals, Oslo emerged to
 respond to a more discerning clientele who value a level of service 
which is savvy, engaged and entrepreneurial.</p>

enjoys the quiet con?dence of industry leadership. You will notice that 
we do not emblaze these claims on everything we do. As we see it, the 
strength of our process and our exceptional results naturally speak for 
themselves.</p>
<p>Oslo is an agency which elevates. At our very core is the 
understanding that positivity renders results and encouragement leads to
 attainment. When we form a relationship with a purchaser or a vendor, 
we become part of their story and they ours. Our process brings their 
property into centre focus and we embark on a collaborative journey with
 a shared vision of success.</p>

calibre and creativity. An agency where we are not shiny, just natural.

loudly, but moulds it quietly.</p>
